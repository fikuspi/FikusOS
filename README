FikusOS - Free x32 DOS-like OS.
Info:
FikusOS is an operating system for real computers and virtual machines. In essence, it is a field for experiments and teaching the authors the basics of C and Assembly. This OS is inspired by FreeDOS and Unix and is essentially its mergers and improvisations from the authors. The entire OS is written from scratch and is a non-commercial product. With this OS you will be able to recall DOS and Unix systems.
History:
Initially, there was a Srunix core, which was developed by the main developer of FikusOS, but which was known to a small circle of people and was written for fun. Afterwards, a fork was made on its basis, which is called Fikus. Fikus as a kernel is still being developed. After creating the kernel structure, it was decided to make FikusOS, which is intended mainly for virtual machines.

# FikusOS - Free simple DOS-like OS.

# Info:

FikusOS is an operating system for real computers and virtual machines. In essence, it is a field for experiments and teaching the authors the basics of C and Assembly. This OS is inspired by FreeDOS and Unix and is essentially its mergers and improvisations from the authors. The entire OS is written from scratch and is a non-commercial product. With this OS you will be able to recall DOS and Unix systems.

# Main questions:

Will there be a GUI for FikusOS? Answer: Officially - no, but you can always create your own fork and add your own GUI there. FikusOS aims to make users nostalgic for DOS.

# We will be glad to any support from your side, you can take part in the development by writing to the author! Thank you for participating in the FikusOS project!

# FikusOS - Free x32 DOS-like OS.

# Info:

FikusOS is an operating system for real computers and virtual machines. In essence, it is a field for experiments and teaching the authors the basics of C and Assembly. This OS is inspired by FreeDOS and Unix and is essentially its mergers and improvisations from the authors. The entire OS is written from scratch and is a non-commercial product. With this OS you will be able to recall DOS and Unix systems.

# History:

Initially, there was a Srunix core, which was developed by the main developer of FikusOS, but which was known to a small circle of people and was written for fun. Afterwards, a fork was made on its basis, which is called Fikus. Fikus as a kernel is still being developed. After creating the kernel structure, it was decided to make FikusOS, which is intended mainly for virtual machines.

# Coming soon:
GUI implementation, 
Improved drivers, 
CPU management, 
Network stack, 
File system, 
And much more. 


# We will be glad to any support from your side, you can take part in the development by writing to the author! Thank you for participating in the FikusOS project!
